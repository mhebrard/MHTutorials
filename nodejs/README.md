# NodeJS Utilities

by Maxime Hebrard

NodeJS is an amazing library that allow to run javascript outside of your browser. You can run javascript on your machine (same as Perl or Python scripts) or event create a node server.
I am new in the this field, but I will share with you some tricks I learn in the process.

## The Software
First you need to be familiar with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).
* Download and install node
* understand what is a node module
* understand how to install one module (with npm, both globally or locally)

## Tutorials

* Scripts (.js file that you will run on your machine)
  * [pack](https://github.com/mhebrard/MHTutorials/tree/master/nodejs/Scripts/pack.js) (compute a [pack layout](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#pack) and save the nodes)
  * [planToSphere](https://github.com/mhebrard/MHTutorials/tree/master/nodejs/Scripts/plantosphere.js) (map nodes on a plan to nodes on a (partial) sphere)
  * [queryAPI](https://github.com/mhebrard/MHTutorials/tree/master/nodejs/Scripts/queryapi.js) (request an API and save the response)
